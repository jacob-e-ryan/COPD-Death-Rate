This is a notebook concerning the crude and age-standardised death rate for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in both the United States and Uganda in 2019.

To calculate the crude death rate, I have multiplied the percentage population of each age group by its respective death rate and summed the answers for both the USA and Uganda data. To calculate the age-standardised death rates, I did the same, but instead using the WHO World Standard population percentages rather than using their actual population.
